Hi! My name is Leo Mansini, and I'm a Computer Science student at University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
- Was going to study physics, but in the process I was completely drawn into Scientific Programming instead!
- In love with python and data science.
- Looking to learn more about Machine Learning, excited about data-related AI!
